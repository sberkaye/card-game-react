# Card Game

Live demo [here](https://cardgamereact.netlify.app/).

This is one of my portfolio projects to demonstrate my abilities in JS, React and web development in general.

A card game where you need to find the unique one after the cards are shuffled.

[React Spring](https://react-spring.io/) has been used to create animations and general styling has been written in Sass..
